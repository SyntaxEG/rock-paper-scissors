# rock-paper-scissors
I am a Python student and this is my first attempt at a game in python.

## Usage
- To start: `python3 main.py`
- To exit: `Ctrl + D`
- Enter numbers 1-3 to select your sign (rock, paper, or scissors). 
- The computer will select a sign at random.
- Score will be added up after each round.

## Future improvement
-[ ] Multiplayer (2 or more)
-[ ] Multiple Game Modes
  -[ ] Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (from the Big Bang Theory)
  -[ ] Rock-Paper-Scissors-Fire-Water (Alternate version I found)
-[ ] A nice way to exit the game
